# Lido for Solana

*Lido for Solana* (“Solido” for short) is a [Lido DAO][lido]-governed liquid
staking protocol for the Solana blockchain. Anyone who stakes their SOL tokens
with Lido will be issued an on-chain representation of the SOL staking position
with Lido validators, called *stSOL*.

Lido for Solana gives you:

 * **Liquidity** — No delegation/activation delays and the ability to sell your
   staked tokens
 * **One-click staking** — No complicated steps
 * **Decentralized security** — Assets spread across the industry’s leading
   validators chosen by the Lido DAO

## Deployments

We continuously develop on the `main` branch in this repository, the code in the
`main` branch may not reflect what is deployed on-chain. Please check the
[deployments docs](https://docs.solana.lido.fi/deployments) for the currently
deployed version, and see [the changelog](CHANGELOG.md) for which versions are
intended for deployment.

## Repository layout

This repository contains the source code for the on-chain program, and for the
`solido` utility to interact with it. The source code for the staking widget,
and documentation, are in a different repository, which is not yet public.

 * `program` — Solido, the on-chain Solana BPF program that implements Lido for
   Solana.
 * `multisig` — A pinned version of the on-chain [Serum multisig
   program][multisig], used as the upgrade authority of the Solido program, and
   as the manager of the Solido instance.
 * `cli` — The command-line `solido` utility for interacting with the on-chain
   programs.
 * `docker` — Dockerfiles for reproducible builds, and for the maintainer image.
 * `testlib` — Utilities for writing tests using the `solana-program-test` test
   framework. The individual tests are in `program/tests`.
 * `tests` — Scripts that test the actual `solido` binary and on-chain program.

## Building

The on-chain programs and `solido` utility are written in Rust. To build them,
you need:

 * An x86_64 Linux machine. Mac should work too, but for reproducibility we
   target Linux.
 * [A Rust toolchain][rust]
 * [The Solana tool suite][solana-tools] (only needed for the on-chain programs,
   not for the `solido` utility)
 * [Docker][docker] (only needed if you want to [reproduce][reproduce] the
   official build, or if you want to avoid installing build tools locally)
 * The following system libraries (listed as Debian package names):
   * `libudev-dev`
   * `libhidapi-dev`
   * `pkg-config`
   * `openssl`
   * `build-essential`
   * `libsqlite3-dev`

The Solana version that we test against is listed in our [CI config][ci-config].

### Cloning the repository

This repository contains a Git submodule. To clone it, pass
`--recurse-submodules`:

```console
$ git clone --recurse-submodules https://github.com/lidofinance/solido
```

If you already cloned the repository without submodules, you can still
initialize them later:

```console
$ git submodule init
$ git submodule update
```

If you have an existing checkout and later update it, make sure to also pass
`--recurse-submodules` when using `git pull` and `git {checkout,switch}`.

### Solido utility

To build and test the `solido` utility, use the normal Cargo commands:

```console
$ cargo test
$ cargo build --release
```

The `solido` binary can then be found in `target/release`.

### On-chain programs

Building the on-chain programs requires [the Solana tool suite][solana-tools]:

```console
$ cargo build-bpf
$ cargo test-bpf
```

The programs `lido.so`, and `serum_multisig.so` can then be found in
`target/deploy`.

### Docker container

To build the container image, use `buildimage.sh`. This will build and package
Solido along with the Solana toolchain into an image `chorusone/solido:«hash»`,
where _«hash»_ will be the Git hash of the current version of the codebase.

Once built, one can execute into the container interactively:

```console
$ docker run --interactive --tty --rm chorusone/solido:hash /bin/sh
```

This will provide a shell into the working directory where the Solido artefacts
and the Solana toolchain are located. Inside that directory, the the `solido`
utility is in `solido/cli`, and the on-chain programs are in `solido/deploy`.
