# Governance Overview

## The Lido DAO
The Lido DAO is a Decentralized Autonomous Organization which governs and enables the development of liquid staking solutions for different blockchains.
The first liquid staking protocol solution was [built for Ethereum](https://blog.lido.fi/staking-ethereum-with-lido/) — and now Lido is expanding to different blockchain networks.

The stake deposited to the Lido contract on Solana is distributed to these validators following a logic similar to the Lido [(stETH) on Ethereum](https://lido.fi/static/Lido:Ethereum-Liquid-Staking.pdf). Lido on Solana has a fee mechanism similar to that on Ethereum which allows splitting fees between node operators and the Lido treasury (e.g. to be used for the insurance fund).
Lido’s decentralized organization brings together the industry’s top staking providers, decentralized finance projects, and investors. The Lido DAO eliminates dependence on a centralized authority, thereby removing the risk of a single point of failure. Distributed governance also fosters a stronger community!
