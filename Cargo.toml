# We take our fork of Solana 1.7.8, which has one patch applied:
# https://github.com/solana-labs/solana/pull/21415.
# This patch enables testing more situations using solana-program-test.
# We need to override the other Solana packages as well because they are interdependent,
# and if we donâ€™t override them, Cargo will include two incompatible versions of those
# packages (one from crates.io and one from the fork).
