//! Utilities for observing a consistent snapshot of on-chain state.
//!
//! The Solana RPC does not have any functionality to query an account at a given
//! block, but it can query multiple accounts at once. Therefore, this module
//! implements an opportunistic way of querying: read all accounts we *expect*
//! to need in one call. If that is all the accounts we really need, then great,
//! we have a consistent view of the on-chain state. If it turns out later that
//! we need to read from an account that is not in our snapshot, then adjust the
//! expected accounts, and retry.
//!
//! There are situations in which this could fail to ever get a useful snapshot.
//! For example, suppose we build a linked list of accounts, where the account's
//! data contains the address of the next account. We want to have a snapshot of
//! the list. If an external process keeps modifying the list, then every time
//! we get a new snapshot, we may find that the tail points to an account that
//! wasn’t yet included in the snapshot, so we retry. But by then, the external
//! process has already modified the tail again, so we are stuck in a loop.
//!
//! This is a pathological example though, for Solido we expect retries to be
//! rare, and when they do happen, they shouldn’t happen repeatedly.
